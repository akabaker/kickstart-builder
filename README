buildks: Builds kickstart files using ks_template.tmpl as a template

Usage:

	buildks [options] <fqdn> <ipaddress> <netmask> <gateway>

	You must specify each of these arguments.

	`buildks -h` will invoke a simple help menu.

	You can edit configuration options in /etc/ks-build/ks-build.conf

Example:

	(Note: buildks is in root's path on rhn)
	buildks -b bakerlu_bootstrap.sh bakerlu-sb.missouri.edu 128.206.0.157 255.255.255.192 128.206.0.190 
	The kickstart file will be named <fqdn>.ks; it is written to /var/www/html/pub/ks/.

	The following options are set by default:

		-Arch=x86_64
		-Release=5
		-Bootstrap=bootstrap.sh (default DoIT group on RHN)
		-Dns=128.206.10.2
		--skip-validate

	These defaults can be overriden by supplying the approprate options. Consider the following:

	buildks --skip-validate -r 6 -a i386 -b bakerlu_bootstrap.sh bakerlu-sb.missouri.edu 128.206.0.157 255.255.255.192 128.206.0.190

	In this example, a kickstart was created with the following parameters:
		-No validation checks performed. A use case would be deploying a machine in the testlab.
		-Release is RHEL6
		-Architecture is i386
		-Bootstrap file to be used is bakerlu_bootstrap.sh
